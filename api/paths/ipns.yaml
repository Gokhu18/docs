  summary: Fetch file from IPNS
  description: The IPNS protocol allows for a user to map their peer ID to an IPFS hash in a cryptographically secure manner. When an IPNS query is made, the server first queries the DHT to resolve the peer ID into an IPFS hash, then proceeds to make an IPFS query given the resolved hash. For example, suppose we have the following mapping..
    ```
    {peerId} = {hash}
    ```
    Then the following API calls are equal...
    ```
    ipfs/{hash}/some_image.jpg
    ipns/{peerId}/some_image.jpg
    ```
